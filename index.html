      Cymbidiums are naturally found at higher altitudes in temperate mid-Asia through southeast Asia and extending as far south as Australia. Colorful and lush, Cymbidiums make dramatically beautiful houseplants. They're among the easiest orchids to grow indoors, reliably producing flower spikes covered with up to 30 blossoms, each 2-5 inches across and lasting 8 weeks or more. They are available in a wide range of fantastic color combinations. All orchids appreciate extra humidity. Place the pot on a pebble tray or near water to increase the ambient moisture. Misting the foliage often will also help a bit. Increasing humidity will help keep mites away. Bacterial and fungal problems can be avoided by giving the plants adequate space and airflow and also by watering and misting early in the morning so they can be dry by nightfall.

      Commonly known as "moth orchids" the very name Phalaenopsis is derived from the Greek words phalaina, moth; and opsis, appearance. Plants in this genus are monopodial and usually epiphytic, although there are ocassional lithophytes and those species formerly included in Doritis are typically terrestrial in their native habitat. There are 63 species, 7 natural hybrids and numerous recognized varietal forms in the genus. Phalaenopsis are among the most popular cultivated orchids and thousands of hybrids have been made throughout the years. The plants, themselves are attractive, with succulent leaves and some species exhibit sweet fragrance. It is a small-to-medium-sized orchid that has beautiful purple flowers. It blooms in spring and summer, and the flowers have a spicy, cinnamon-like fragrance.

         With huge, dinner-plate colorful flowers, perennial hibiscus plants add a bold, tropical effect to the garden. They are also highly attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds! Here's how to plant, grow, and care for hibiscus. Hibiscus is a plant that can grow in a bush or as tall as a tree. Trees of this species sometimes reach up to 15 feet high. The most commonly grown is hibiscus syriacus, or rose of Sharon, which is a perennial that is grown as a bush or tree that can get up to 12 feet tall. The plant has 679 different species of many sizes, colors, and even shapes. Most of these are perennials, but a few are annuals. There are many types of hibiscus. This growing guide covers perennial hibiscus which are grown for their strikingly beautiful, big, disc-shaped, hollyhock-like flowers that can measure up to 12 inches across.

           Heliconias (hel-lick-KOE-nee-uhs) are true rainforest beauties. Gardeners love their lush foliage and bright, striking bracts. Ecologists, too, are fascinated by the plant's link to rainforest birds. Hailing from the tropical Americas and the Pacific, heliconia species are well-adapted for hot and steamy weather. These Florida-Friendly plants flourish in the warmer half of the state.Characteristics Most Heliconia species are pollinated by hummingbirds, with a few species pollinated by bats. Cross pollination between species is rarely successful in cultivation, and is unheard of in the wild. Plant heliconia anytime the weather is warm but choose the site with care. They prefer a spot with partial sun or shade. Some heliconias, like lobster claw, can tolerate full sun. One non-negotiable is fertile, moist soil. If your soil is on the sandy side, till in some compost to the entire bed before you plant. Regular fertilizing during the growing season will keep heliconia looking its best.

            Native to the temperate and tropical parts of the world. blue lotus or sacred blue lily of the Nile, is a tropical water lily that features day-blooming, star-shaped flowers (to 4-6” across), each with upright, pointed, light blue petals spread flat on the water surface. Each leaf is connected directly to the plant rhizomes by a long leaf stalk (petiole). Flowers typically bloom from July to the end of summer. This water lily is native to northern and central Africa. Although once abundant in the Nile Delta, blue lotus has now mostly disappeared from that area where it is now endangered. Blue lotus is sacred to Egyptian culture as a symbol of creation and rebirth. Ancient Egyptians believed the world was originally covered by water and darkness. Then a large blue lotus appeared in the water, the flower opened and light appeared thus ending darkness on earth. Water lilies provide food for fish and wildlife but sometimes cause drainage problems because of their rapid growth. Some flowers open only in the morning or in the evening to attract insect pollinators. The fruit is usually nutlike or berrylike. Some fruits ripen underwater until they rupture or decay, and the seeds then float away or sink.</p>

               Orchids have a wide ecological distribution when the entire family is considered. Although the family is primarily tropical, a number of species are found in the northern and southern temperate zones. At least four species have been reported from north of the Arctic Circle. A number of species of the North Temperate Zone are found in bogs, prairies, grasslands, and hardwood forests. A diverse and widespread group of flowering plants with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant. Orchidaceae is one of the two largest families of flowering plants, along with the Asteraceae. It contains about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed across 763 genera. Which of the two families is larger is still unclear, because new members of both of these enormous families are continually discovered. Regardless, the number of orchid species is nearly equal to the number of bony fishes, more than twice the number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species.</p>

                <div class="column-2">
                <p>Tropical plants thrive best in potting mixes containing one-half soil, two-half peat moss, and two parts perlite. Allowing the soil to drain for a week will prevent it from holding excess water (which can rot root tissue) and will also keep it from drying out too quickly, causing brown leaf tips. The best soil for tropical plants is a well-drained, loose soil that is high in organic matter. This type of soil will hold moisture and nutrients well, while also allowing excess water to drain away quickly. </p>
          
                <p>Tropical plants require special soil in order to grow. In nature, the vast majority of them grow in a loose, porous medium containing bark and light organic matter, in conditions similar to that in a rainforest. It is critical to have this medium in order to provide good drainage for healthy roots.</p>
          
                <p>A large area of Africa, Asia, and North and South America is covered by Oxisols, Ultisols, Alfisols, Aridisol, Inceptisols, and Entisols, and all of these soils are found in tropical areas of Africa, Asia, and They all have some characteristics in common.</p>
          
                <p>Despite its lower nutrients content, cactus soil is not as nutrient-rich as potting soil. Indoor plants, on the other hand, do not require much nutrients and are accustomed to growing on very limited amounts of water and nutrients.</p>
